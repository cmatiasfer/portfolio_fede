                        We are an independent design studio based in Buenos Aires.
                        We believe that design is fundamentally a problem solving 
                        exercise that can be applied to any sector, discipline or media. 
                        We produce work that aims to be meanful and distintive by working

                    <p>
                        Before working independently Federico Bianchi studied the Graphic Design career, obtaining said Title at the University
                        from Buenos Aires (UBA).<br>
                        <br>
                        Later in 2002 he moved to live in the city of Barcelona,
                        where he worked for nine years in studies of great importance as
                        Dockland, Summa, Ruiz + company, Enric Aguilera Asociados and Zelig Studio.
                        At the same time he collaborated in the Federico Helman Advertising Agency,
                        where he worked in the development of the brand Ciudad de Buenos Aires.<br>
                        <br>
                        During 2009-2010 he completed a Master in Motion Graphics at the School
                        BAU of Barcelona and at the same time began his journey as a designer
                        freelance working for brands and projects in that city.<br>

                        Since 2010 he resides again in Argentina, where he carries out
                        different projects in his own studio, either for his own clients
                        in Barcelona and Buenos Aires or collaborating for agencies 
                        or studios in both cities.
